1. what is java ?
 java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

2.java simple program ?
public class Simple {
public static void main(String args[]){
System.out.println("Hello world");
}
}.

3.Features of Java ?
Simple , Robust , Secure , high performance , multithreaded , platform independent.

4. class keyword is used to declare class in java
   public keyword is access modifier that represents visibility, ie visible to all.
   The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method.
   Void is return type method it mean it does not return any value.
   main represents starting point of program.
   
5.The JVM performs the following main tasks:

Loads code
Verifies code
Executes code
Provides runtime environment.

6. Variable ?
 Variable is name of reserved area allocated in memory. in other words name of memery location.

7.Types of variable ?
.local variable = declared inside body of method.

.static variable = variable declared as static is called static variable.
.instance variable =declared inside class but outside body of method.

Example of variables .
public class A
{
static int m=100;//static variable
void method()
{
int n=90;//local variable
}

public static void main(String args[])
{
int data=50;//instance variable
}
}//end of class


Data types are the diffrent sizes and values which can be stored in variable. 

there are 2 types of data types 
1 primitive data type =boolean , char ,int,byte,short,long,float,double. 
2 non primitive data type=classes , interfaces and arrays.

Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations. For example: +, -, *, / etc.

There are many types of operators in Java which are given below:

Unary Operator,
Arithmetic Operator,
Shift Operator,
Relational Operator,
Bitwise Operator,
Logical Operator,
Ternary Operator and
Assignment Operator.

Java provides three types of control flow statements.

1.Decision Making statements
if statements
switch statement
2.Loop statements
do while loop
while loop
for loop
for-each loop
3.Jump statements
break statement
continue statement

..OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)
Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts 

Object
Class
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation
 

.Object =

object is entity which has state and behavior . ex , chair , pen etc

Example: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.

.class =
collection of object is class . it is logical entity. class doesnt consume ant space.

.Inheritance =

when one object acquires all the properties and behaviour of parent object,it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability . It is used to achieve run time polymorphism.

.polymorphism =

when one task is performed in diffrent ways it is know as polymorphism .
In java we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

.Abstraction =

Hiding internal details and showing functionality is know as abstraction.
In java we use abstract class and interface to achieve Abstraction

.Encapulation=
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as Encapulation For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.

1) OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.

2) OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be accessed from anywhere.
